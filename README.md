# Bikesharing
## Overview of Project
This project analyzed data from the New York City's Bike program to see if recreating the program in De Moines, Iowa would be a good idea. The project was completed by editing the data using Python's pandas library then using Tableau to create visualizations.  \
[NYC_CitiBike_Challenge.ipynb](https://github.com/juliacho22/bikesharing/blob/main/NYC_CitiBike_Challenge.ipynb). 

## Results
The following questions were explored for the the projects: 
1. How long do users bike for?
2. Who is using the bikes?
3. When are users using the bikes?
4. Where are the users biking to and from?

### How long do users bike for?
The chart below shows the time of every bike ride during the month of August in 2019. It shows that riders typically like to bike between 2 and 15 minutes. \

### Who is using the bikes?
The chart below shows the breakdown of riders by gender and duration of times showing that most of the users are men. \

We can also see that the most common user is male, and the most frequent day of the week to ride on is Thursday. \

### When are users using the bikes?
This image below shows that weekday rider traffic peaks at traditional commuting times, while weekends see gradual use throughout the day. \

The below shows the breakdown by gender \

### Where are thge users biking to and from?
The two images below show the the top starting and ending locations. Most rides start and end in mid and lower Manhattan \

## Summary 
Based on the findings above, to create a successful bike program in De Moines, one should target men as the main user demographic and position bikes int he most populated areas. Additionally, one could add visualization studying the age of the users to narrow down the advertisement target even further.
